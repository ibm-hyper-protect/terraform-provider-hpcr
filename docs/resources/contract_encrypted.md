# hpcr_contract_encrypted (Resource)

Generates an encrypted and signed HPCR contract for deployment to Hyper Protect instances. This resource is the final step in the contract creation workflow, taking a YAML contract specification and producing an encrypted, signed user data field ready for VM provisioning.

## Overview

The HPCR contract defines what workload runs in your secure enclave and how it's configured. This resource:

1. Takes a YAML-serialized contract as input
2. Signs the contract with a private key (generated or provided)
3. Encrypts the contract with an HPVS encryption certificate
4. Outputs Base64-encoded user data for IBM Cloud VPC instance deployment

## Contract Structure

An HPCR contract typically contains these sections:

- **workload**: Defines the containerized application (docker-compose or podman play)
- **env**: Environment variables, logging configuration, and runtime settings
- **attestationPublicKey** (optional): Public key for attestation encryption

See the [contract-go documentation](https://ibm-hyper-protect.github.io/contract-go) for detailed contract schema information.

## Signing and Encryption

**Signing**: Contracts are signed to prove authenticity. You can provide your own private key via `privkey`, or let the resource generate a temporary key.

**Encryption**: Contracts are encrypted using HPVS encryption certificates. By default, the latest certificate is used. Specify `cert` for version-specific encryption.

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    hpcr = {
      source  = "ibm-hyper-protect/hpcr"
      version = "~> 0.16.2"
    }
  }
}

# Create TGZ archive from pods folder
resource "hpcr_tgz" "contract" {
  folder = "pods"
}

# Define contract in clear text
locals {
  contract = yamlencode({
    "env" : {
      "type" : "env",
      "logging" : {
        "logRouter" : {
          "hostname" : "5c2d6b69-c7f0-41bd-b69b-240695369d6e.ingress.us-south.logs.cloud.ibm.com",
          "iamApiKey" : "ab00e3c09p1d4ff7fff9f04c12183413"
        }
      }
    },
    "workload" : {
      "type" : "workload",
      "play" : {
        "archive" : hpcr_tgz.contract.rendered
      }
    },
  })
}

# Basic contract with auto-generated signing key
resource "hpcr_contract_encrypted" "contract" {
  contract = local.contract
}

output "contract_rendered" {
  value = hpcr_contract_encrypted.contract.rendered
}

output "contract_sha256_in" {
  value = hpcr_contract_encrypted.contract.sha256_in
}

output "contract_sha256_out" {
  value = hpcr_contract_encrypted.contract.sha256_out
}

# Contract with custom encryption certificate
resource "hpcr_contract_encrypted" "contract_cert" {
  contract = local.contract
  cert     = file("./cert/encrypt.crt")
}

output "contract_cert_rendered" {
  value = hpcr_contract_encrypted.contract_cert.rendered
}

# Contract with custom signing key
resource "hpcr_contract_encrypted" "contract_privkey" {
  contract = local.contract
  privkey  = file("./cert/private.pem")
}

output "contract_privkey_rendered" {
  value = hpcr_contract_encrypted.contract_privkey.rendered
}

# Platform-specific contract
resource "hpcr_contract_encrypted" "contract_platform" {
  contract = local.contract
  platform = "hpvs"
}

output "contract_platform_rendered" {
  value = hpcr_contract_encrypted.contract_platform.rendered
}
```

## Attestation

After deployment, retrieve the attestation record from your HPCR instance to verify the contract was loaded correctly:

```terraform
data "hpcr_attestation" "verify" {
  attestation = "..." # Retrieved from instance
  privkey     = file("./signing-key.pem")
}
```

## Best Practices

- Use separate `hpcr_text_encrypted` resources for workload and env sections when they contain sensitive data
- Store signing keys securely (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)
- Match encryption certificate version with your HPCR image version
- Track contract checksums (`sha256_in`, `sha256_out`) for audit trails
- Test contracts in development environments before production deployment

## Schema

### Required

- `contract` (String, Sensitive) YAML serialization of the contract

### Optional

- `cert` (String) Certificate used to encrypt the contract, in PEM format. Defaults to the latest HPCR image certificate if not specified.
- `platform` (String) Hyper Protect platform where this contract will be deployed. Defaults to hpvs
- `privkey` (String, Sensitive) Private key used to sign the contract. If omitted, a temporary signing key is created.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Resource identifier
- `rendered` (String) Rendered output of the resource
- `sha256_in` (String) SHA256 of the input
- `sha256_out` (String) SHA256 of the output
